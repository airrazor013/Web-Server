            Our project won the 1st place prize for hardware, as well as the 1st place prize for most ethical hack.<br /><br />

            During this event, I was tasked with setting up the hardware required for the project, as well as coding the microcontroler. <br />
            The microcontroler took atmospheric noise as an input.
            There were 8 data lines connected from the microcontroler to the Raspbery Pi.<br />
            These lines could be polled at any time to construct a byte that would be used as part of the encryption.<br />
            Once the device had been polled enough times, it would create a keys from the bytes received. These keys were then used to preform RSA encryption on the Raspbery Pi.<br />

            <br /><br />
