    <br/><h1 class="heading"><strong>All in One</strong></h1>
    <p class="textProject"> This app is my personal project
        that is connected to my personal back-end server to allow for users to create accounts.
        This will be used in future implementations to expand to a multiplayer setting. The first
        picture is the login fragment which users can swipe on to get to the create user fragment.</p>
    <p class="textProject">The second picture is of the
        home page which allows users to choose from 20 or 30 cards to play. It also includes an options
        menu attached. Here users can mute music or sound, change the theme, or edit their profile.
        The theme activity allows users to change the entire theme of the app. The edit profile activity
        allows users to change their username, password, or icon.</p>

    <img class="image" src="images/ethan/memory.png"/>
    <p class="textProject">The third picture is of the game its self. The cards are randomized
        by putting each one in an array list and calling the java shuffle command. They are
        then setup into a grid view as shown. A timer is used to record the score of the round
        which will be put on the back-end server.</p>

    <br/><h1 class="heading"><strong>Drinker's Choice</strong></h1><br/>
    <p class="textProject">Drinker's Choice was another app I did as a class project that
        really got me into Android development. Drinker's Choice was an app made for people
        to post drinks, get rides, and see business promotions. Throughout the project,
        I worked on front-end development making the login and create user activities that
        would sign 3 different types of users in. I also helped with the endpoint and server
        commnication classes and created the websocket seen in the first picture below.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/ethan/websocket.png"/>
    <img class="image" src="images/ethan/comments.png"/>
    <p class="textProject">I also created the comments activity seen in the second photo. It had
        functionality for users to up vote, down vote, and leave comments on the posts. There
        where still some bugs that would have been squashed given enough time. This was my
        fist major software team project and first time I lead a software team project.</p>

  <div class = "project">
    <br/><h1 class="heading"><strong>HackISU Fall 2019</strong></h1><br/>
    <p class="textProject">At HackISU last November, my team achieved first place in hardware
        hack and first place in ethical hack. I was tasked with implemeting the gpio binary inputs
        from the arduino and converting them into characters and creating two strings. One was
        used as a key for the encryption and the other was used for the initialization vector.
        I also helped with the other gpio inputs and outputs.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/ethan/secret.png"/>
    <p class="textProject">The main purpose was to get a truely random string as a key from
        the enviornment using a microphone. Using this key, a file would be encrypted then
        the key and encrypted file would be hidden in pictures on different drives.

    <br/><h1 class="heading"><strong>Web Server</strong></h1><br/>
    <p class=textProject>This website you are viewing now is hosted on my personal server
        just like my app All in One. The backend is coded in node.js and is setup to host multiple
        domains. I have been working on this with my friend, <a href="camdent.net" style="color:#E36161;">
        Camden Thomas</a>. The backend is set up in a way that
        adding a new webpage is as easy as putting the html file in the correct directory. I also
        created a function to send emails to an email account when someone contacts me through this site.</p>
